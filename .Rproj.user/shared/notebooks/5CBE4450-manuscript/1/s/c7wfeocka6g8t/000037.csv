"0","#Network properties: Let’s now try to describe what a network looks like as a whole. We can start with measures of the size of a network. diameter is the length of the longest path (in number of edges) between two nodes. We can use get_diameter to identify this path. mean_distance is the average number of edges between any two nodes in the network. We can find each of these paths between pairs of edges with distances. "

"0","# Network communities - Networks often have different clusters or communities of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. Let’s cover some of the different existing methods to identify these communities. The most straightforward way to partition a network is into connected components. Each component is a group of nodes that are connected to each other, but not to the rest of the nodes. For example, this network has two components."
